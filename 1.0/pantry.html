				<h1>Pantry</h1>
				<h1>Winter 2014 &middot; Stanford, CA</h1>
				<p>Pantry was created as a collaborative web app to keep track of foods and items in a shared kitchen. I worked on a team along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-lamb-b134937b" target="_blank" class="bold">Andy Lamb</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-campbell-05692930" target="_blank" class="bold">Ian Campbell</a> to design and develop the idea. The project was my first foray into interaction for a course called <a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cs+147&view=catalog&page=0&academicYear=20132014&filter-term-Winter=on&filter-day-4=on&collapse=%2C4%2C&filter-coursestatus-Active=on" target="_blank" class="bold">CS 147: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design</a>.</p>
				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>In shared kitchens, there's often a gap in how the kitchen is managed: with many people sharing a kitchen and its contents, it's often difficult to properly restock and keep track of foods and ingredients. Even when there is someone designated, with so many opinions in play, there must be a better solution.</p>
				<p>This problem is evident in many dorms on Stanford's campus. Even with a kitchen manager to help manage the snacks and ingredients available in open kitchens, things often get dirty, and it's difficult to figure out what groceries need to be bought.</p>

				<h2>The Approach</h2>
				<p>Seeing the dorm's wish list for foods grow more unruly week after week, we were inspired to do something about it. Looking at the check marks of support, we figured we could translate the dorm's grocery list to an online version with upvoting and downvoting &agrave; la Reddit. Before long, we had also incorporated a way to keep track of foods already in the pantry, as well as a recipe generator based on available ingredients.</p>
				<h2>Iteration and Testing</h2>
				<p>In designing and developing Pantry, we leveraged Google Analytics to do some A/B testing on our voting features. We also performed some heuristic evaluations with our target users to find room for improvement in our app's interface.</p>
