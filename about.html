          My name is Aaron, and I am a designer living and working in San Francisco. Born and raised in the Silicon Valley, I grew up questioning every product and interface I interacted with, leading me to study a mix of computer science and product design at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. While at Stanford I spent a fall in NYC as part of the <a href="https://undergrad.stanford.edu/stanford-in-new-york">Stanford in New York</a> program.

          In the past, I have worked as both a software engineer and designer, sometimes in hybrid roles. Previous experience includes larger companies (<a href="https://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>) and smaller startups (<a href="https://www.qualia.com/">Qualia</a>, <a href="https://nextdoor.com/">Nextdoor</a>) alike. In 2015, I was also a <a href="http://kpcbfellows.com/">KPCB Engineering Fellow</a>.

        <p>
          Having studied human-computer interaction and design thinking and worked at startups in San Francisco and a design firm in New York, I have been exposed to a number of different approaches to design, each with their relative merits. While I try to avoid subscribing to a single approach or school of thought, I strongly believe in user-centered design, and I will always advocate the best experience for the user given the constraints.

          I am a generalist and full-stack designer, able to mock up user flows and prototype them in code. I've also worked in a wide variety of disciplines: user research, UI/UX design, prototyping, front-end web development, and even industrial design. That being said, I find I have most depth in user experience, although I look to continue to grow across the board, particularly in my visual and graphic design skills.

          I'm always open to new opportunities, whether that means contract work or meeting someone new over coffee or tea. Possible talking points include building and riding bicycles, new boba/brunch/KBBQ spots, and most genres of music.
