				<h1>Pantry</h1>
				<h2>Winter 2014 &middot; Stanford, CA</h2>

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>In every kitchen, it's always difficult to know what foods are in pantry and what foods need to be bought on the next grocery run. Pantry is a collaborative mobile web app that helps keep track of items and ingredients in a shared kitchen. This project was my first foray into human-computer interaction.</p>
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Led concept ideation and overall app design. Performed heuristic evaluations and user testing. Contributed to front-end development.</p>

				<h3>Context</h3>
				<h4>The Unorganized Kitchen</h4>
				<p>In shared kitchens, there's often a gap in how the kitchen is managed: with many people sharing a kitchen and its contents, it's often difficult to properly restock and keep track of foods and ingredients. Even when there is someone designated, with so many opinions in play, there must be a better solution.</p>
				<p>This problem is evident in many dorms on Stanford's campus. Even with a kitchen manager to help manage the snacks and ingredients available in open kitchens, things often get dirty, and it's difficult to figure out what groceries need to be bought.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<h4>Who's Responsible?</h4>
				<p>In many households, there is someone in charge of the kitchen and its contents. At Stanford, houses often have kitchen managers for this. But with 60 students sharing a single kitchen, things can get a little chaotic. It's difficult to buy foods to please people's varying tastes, and to know when certain snacks or ingredients need to be restocked.</p>

				<p class="img-caption">Our dorm's chaotic grocery list, complete with check marks of support.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Approach</h3>
				<h4>Upvoting and Downvoting Ideas</h4>
				<p>Seeing the dorm's wish list for foods grow more unruly week after week, we were inspired to do something about it. Looking at the check marks of support, we figured we could translate the dorm's grocery list to an online version with upvoting and downvoting Ã  la Reddit. Before long, we had also incorporated a way to keep track of foods already in the pantry, as well as a recipe generator based on available ingredients.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Iteration</h3>
				<h4>Testing the Interface</h4>
				<p>In designing and developing Pantry, we leveraged Google Analytics to do some A/B testing on our voting features. We also performed some heuristic evaluations with our target users to find room for improvement in our app's interface.</p>

					<p class="img-caption">We tested and developed our app continuously.</p>

				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<h4>The Final App</h4>
				<p>Over time, our idea had evolved from a grocery list with upvoting to collaborative pantry-tracking app. Feel free to peruse <a href="img/pantry/poster.pdf" target="_blank" class="bold">our poster</a>, which explains our features and process.</p>

				<ul class="list">
					<p class="bold">Shared Pantry</p>
				</ul>
				<img src="img/pantry/shared-pantry.jpg"></img>
				<ul class="list">
					<p>The core of the app is the Shared Pantry feature. With it, you can see the names of items in the pantry, along with their corresponding categories and expiration dates. You can sort by name, category, or date, and it's easy to add or edit items in the pantry.</p>
					<p class="bold">Grocery List</p>
				</ul>
				<img src="img/pantry/grocery-list.jpg"></img>
				<ul class="list">
					<p>The Grocery List allows collaborators in a pantry to contribute item ideas for the kitchen manager. With upvoting, it's easy to see which items need to be picked up at the store. And upon returning home, there's a simple button to move grocery list items directly to the pantry.</p>
					<p class="bold">Smart Recipes</p>
				</ul>
				<img src="img/pantry/smart-recipes.jpg"></img>
				<ul class="list">
					<p>We were able to leverage the Yummly API to give users an easy way to cook out of their pantry. Parsing through the inventory, the app recommends recipes for users to make the most of their available ingredients.</p>
				</ul>

				<h3>Impact</h3>
				<h4>Reception and Feedback</h4>
				<p>Users and teaching staff loved our product, particularly praising the smart recipes feature, as well as the ability to maintain and collaborate on multiple pantries. The project was a great experience overall, and an awesome way to get my feet wet with human-computer interaction.</p>
