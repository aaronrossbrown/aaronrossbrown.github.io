							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>At Stanford, <a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=ME+203&view=catalog&page=0&academicYear=20142015&filter-term-Spring=on&filter-units-4=on&filter-component-LEC=on&collapse=%2C2%2C6%2C&filter-coursestatus-Active=on" target="_blank" class="bold">ME 203: Design and Manufacturing</a> is a rite of passage for mechanical engineering and product design students. The class throws you headfirst into Stanford's <a href="http://productrealization.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" class="bold">Product Realization Lab</a> to manufacture a product of your own design using machining sand casting, or welding.</p>
							<h3>Role</h3>
							<p>Designed bench, moving from initial ideas through prototyping and some CAD. Manufactured bench from steel tubing and cherry wood, primarily using welding and woodworking processes.</p>

					<h3>Approach</h3>
					<h4>Designing and Prototyping</h4>
					<p>Going into the class, I had a few ideas as to what I wanted to buildâ€”I wanted to gain experience with TIG welding as my main process, and with a budding passion for all things cycling-related, I figured I would design and manufacture a product for my bike. The possibilities were endless, though active brake lights, integrated headlights, and bike stands quickly came to mind.</p>
					<p>Over time, my focused in on bike storage. With apartment living in my future, and welding being the perfect process for something structural, I sought inspiration to build myself my own pedestal to display and store my bike. I prototyped various features and designs in my dorm room, thinking about size, shelving, and possibly even lighting.</p>

				<p>As I further designed my pedestal, constraint upon constraint popped up. How was I going to hold a bike upright in a manner that was structurally sound? How might the product be transported and built? And how was I going to afford the materials, including such a large hardwood base?</p>
				<p>In continuing to search for answers, I was inspired by the George Nelson bench. Instead of making a short pedestal, I could make a bench at sitting height, and incorporate the use of wooden slats as opposed to a single, wide piece of hardwood. Slats would be easier to source and produce, and they also gave a means of holding my bike upright with the spaces in between. Additionally, using slats made the product easily assembled and torn down.</p>

				<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
				<p>Having finalized my design, I went to the shop and began making the bench. The first few weeks were spent learning how to weld so I could cut steel tubing and form the rectangular legs of the bench. After a significant amount of grinding and drilling, the legs were ready for a powder coat. The last week of manufacturing was dedicated to cutting, planing, routing, and finishing the cherry slats that would hold the bench and the bike together.</h4>
