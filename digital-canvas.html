				<h1>Digital Canvas</h1>
				<h2>Fall 2014 - Winter 2016 &middot; Stanford, CA</h2>

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>At Stanford, visual design is a skill that many computer science students want to learn but isn’t really taught in classes. To help bring visual design to campus, we started a student-intiated course called CS 91SI: Digital Canvas. The course was offered in three different quarters over two academic years and was well-received by its students and the computer science department.</p>
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>As teaching assistant, led critiques and designed course website. Later developed curriculum and taught as a co-instructor in the course’s third quarter of instuction.</p>

				<h3>Context</h3>
					<h4>Visual Design at Stanford</h4>
					<p>While Stanford has a wealth of opportunities to offer its students, you’d be hard-pressed to find a place to learn visual design on campus. Before CS 91SI: Digital Canvas, there was no single course to learn visual design in the context of web and mobile interfaces. Instead, students tend to pick up bits and pieces in different places on campus: human-computer interaction classes, design thinking classes, and art classes.</p>

			<div class="copy">
				<p>Two students, Ishita Prasad and Paula Kusumaputri, wanting to do something about it. Being computer science students with backgrounds in art, they decided to create a student-initated course, where student instructors could teach others design in a small classroom format. I heard about their intiative and soon hopped on as a teaching assistant.</p>

				<h3>Approach</h3>
				<h4>Outlining Our Objectives</h4>
				<p>From the start, we knew our audience for the class was computer science students with the web development skills to create websites but without the visual design skills to design them. With these students as our primary stakeholder, we came up with the following objectives:</p>
				<ol class="list">
					<h5><li>Give students the visual design skills necessary to design and develop websites</li></h5>
					<h5><li>Develop within students the language necessary to give and receive feedback</li></h5>
					<h5><li>Equip students with the latest design tools and the ability to adapt to new ones</li></h5>
				</ol>

				<h3>Solution<h3>
				<h4>Developing the Curriculum</h4>
				<p>Digital Canvas focused on teaching visual design principles and giving students hands-on experience. Week to week, classes focused on the basics of visual design, including elements and principles, color, typography, layout, and more, with a curriculum developed by the student instructors. And throughout the quarter, students work on a quarter-long project designing a website of their choosing, from thumbnail sketches to wireframes to full mockups. Feel free to take a look at <a href="img/digital-canvas/syllabus.pdf" target="_blank" class="bold">our most recent syllabus</a>.</p>
				<!-- Link to syllabus -->
				<h4>Structuring the Course</h4>
				<p>The course is structured in two components: lectures and critiques. With lectures, we would cover individual topics, looking towards good and bad examples of visual design principles. And in critiques, students would bring in their weekly project milestones to particpate in staff-led group critiques. Students both presented their own work and commented on the work of their peers. With an enrollment cap of 20 students and 4 teaching staff, the 5:1 student-teacher ratio allowed students to develop a language around visual design. Occasionally, design professionals from companies like <a href="https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/design/" target="_blank" class="bold">Palantir</a> and <a href="http://www.1185design.com/" target="_blank" class="bold">1185 Design</a> come in to give guest lectures and provide feedback to students on their projects.</p>

				<h3>Iteration</h3>
				<h4>Refining the Course</h4>
				<p>Over the two years of the course's existence, steady improvements were made to the course's curriculum and structure. We iterated on project milestones and in-class activities, and created <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs91si/student/" target="_blank" class="bold">a course website</a>. We even conducted a rigorous study on effective critique formats in Digital Canvas, writing <a href="img/digital-canvas/paper.jpg" target="_blank" class="bold">a full research paper</a> as part of another class, <a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cs+376&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20142015" target="_blank" class="bold">CS 376: Human-Computer Interaction Research</a>. </p>

				<h3>Impact</h3>
				<h4>Mentoring Beginning Designers</h4>
				<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of the course was being able to teach and mentor students in the basics of visual design. While much of my time at Stanford was spent learning from others, being able to teach others showed me the importance of the mentor-mentee relationship and sharing knowledge among others.</p>

				<h4>Reception and Feedback</h4>
				<p>Each time Digital Canvas was offered, the course received rave reviews from students and teaxhers alike, consistently receiving above average reviews for the computer science department. Interest in Digital Canvas remains strong, with a large number of applicants every quarter from a variety of academic majors and disciplines. We hope the course continues into the future in the hands of upperclassmen willing and able to teach visual design to other students on campus.</p>
