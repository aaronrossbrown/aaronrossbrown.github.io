				<h1>Digital Canvas</h1>
				<h1>Instructor &amp; Critique Leader &middot; Fall 2014 - Winter 2016 &middot; Stanford, CA</h1>
				<p>In my third and fourth years at Stanford, I helped teach a student-initiated course called <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs91si/student/" target="_blank" class="bold">CS 91SI: Digital Canvas</a>. The course connects beginning visual designers with experienced mentors for a ten-week workshop focused on visual design on the web.</p>
				<h2>The Begnnings of Digital Canvas</h2>
				<p>While Stanford is renowned for the d.school and its roots in design thinking, it lacks a strong community for student designers, particularly those interested in visual or interaction design. And while students might cross paths in human-computer interaction classes, it's difficult for them to find spaces to talk about design, let alone learn more about different design disciplines they're interested in. Two upperclassmen, <a href="http://www.ishitaprasad.com/index.html" target="_blank" class="bold">Ishita Prasad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulaksp" target="_blank" class="bold">Paula Kusumaputri</a>, noticed this lack of design resources and wanted to do something about it.</p>
				<p>In the fall of 2014, they taught the first run of Digital Canvas, a class for computer science students to learn more about visual design principles and how they can be used when designing web interfaces. After a successful first quarter, the class was offered twice more, once in the spring of 2015 and again in the winter of 2016. I helped teach the course as a critique leader in its first two runs, and then ran the course as one of two instructors in its third run.</p>

				<h2>The Course Structure</h2>
				<p>Digital Canvas focuses on teaching visual design principles and giving students hands-on experience, with classes structured in two components: lecture and critique. Week to week, lectures focus on the basics of visual design, including elements and principles, color, typography, layout, and more, with a curriculum developed by the student instructors. Occasionally, design professionals from companies like <a href="https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/design/" target="_blank" class="bold">Palantir</a> and <a href="http://www.1185design.com/" target="_blank" class="bold">1185 Design</a> come in to give guest lectures and provide feedback to students on their projects. Meanwhile, students work on a quarter-long project designing a website of their choosing, from thumbnail sketches to wireframes to full mockups.</p>
				<p>The second component of each class, the critique, is even more essential to the course. As students bring in work on their weekly project milestones, they particpate in staff-led group critiques, in which students both present their own work and comment on the work of their peers. With an enrollment cap of 20 students and 4 teaching staff, the 5 to 1 student-teacher ratio allows students to develop much greater facility of visual design as the course progresses.<p>
				<h2>Refining the Course</h2>
				<p>Over the two years of the course's existence, we've made steady improvements to the course curriculum and structure. We've iterated on  project milestones, in-class activities, and the way we as teaching staff provide feedback to students. We've even conducted a rigorous study on effective critique formats in Digital Canvas as part of another class, <a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cs+376&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20142015" target="_blank">CS 376: Human-Computer Interaction Research</a>. <a href="img/digitalcanvas/paper.pdf" target="_blank" class="bold">Here's the research paper</a> if you're interested.</p>

				<h2>Impact and Takeaways</h2>
				<p>Every quarter Digital Canvas is offered, the course receives rave reviews from students, consistently scoring above average for the department. Interest in Digital Canvas remains strong, with a large number of applicants from a variety of academic majors and disciplines. We hope the class continues in the hands of new upperclassmen who are willing and able to keep teaching visual design to other students on campus.</p>
				<p>For me, Digital Canvas has become a major part of my Stanford career. Being able to teach and mentor students in the basics of visual design was extremely rewarding, and taught me the importance of the mentor-mentee relationship and sharing knowledge among others. Not to mention I also became much better versed in visual design and in participating in and facilitating design critiques.</p>
