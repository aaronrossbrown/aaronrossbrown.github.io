						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Choreographers and dancers are always listening and brainstorming, but the process of developing a new dance routine has room for improvement. Stepnote is a web application created to help choreographers both record and recall their ideas. Stepnote was developed end-to-end from user interviews all the way to a working prototype.</p>
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Created low-fidelity prototypes and ran user testing. Contributed to interaction design and front-end development.</p>

				<h4>The Data Narratives of Choreographers</h4>
				<p>The process of choreographing a dance routine is complex. </p>

				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<h4>Understanding Choreographers' Behavior</h4>
				<p>Focusing in on designing a tool for choreography, we first talked to our main stakeholders: the choreographers themselves. Meeting with a wide range of choreographers from classical Indian dance to hip hop, we wanted to understand how choreographers chose music, looked for inspiration, and constructed their dance routines.</p>
				<p>Two things were clear and evident by the end of our interviews. First, the process behind choreography varies person to person and is often unique, with some users taking detailed notes with timestamps and others taking minmal or no notes at all. Second, every choreographer struggled to recall things, whether it was an inspiring dance move from a YouTube video, or the latest set of steps they chose when they last sat down to choreograph.</p>
				<!--<p>To condense the diverse set of skill levels, behaviors, and attitudes of the choreographers we talked to, we created three user personas to design for.</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Freestyle Freddie: </li>
					<li>Structured Shilpa: </li>
					<li>Novice Nancy: </li>
				</ul>-->
				<hr>
				<h3>Approach</h3>
				<h4>Needfinding and Ideation</h4>
				<p>With a struggle to recall ideas being the main gap in our users' behavior, we brainstormed some concepts to help users remember their sources of inspiration and the dance moves that they were choreographing. Some concepts focused on splicing existing moves from YouTube videos, while others helped choreographers understand their repetoire of steps.</p>

				<h3>Iteration</h3>
				<h4>User Studies</h4>
				<p>Moving forward, we decided to stick with our best idea, Song Annotator&mdash;the idea was feasible to prototype and test in three weeks, and it seemed to resonate best with the choreographers we interviewed. Now there remained two questions to answer. What screen size would we develop for, web or mobile? And what format of annotations would we support: text, audio, or video?</p>
				<p>We quickly moved to low-fidelity paper prototypes, testing the possible combinations of screen size and annotation format with multiple choreographers. Before, long, we had chosen a web application that would support text based annotations.</p>

				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<h4>Stepnote, the Song Annotator</h4>
				<p>We built our web application using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Before long, we had our working prototype, which you can explore <a href="http://stanford.edu/~ishitap/stepnote/" target="_blank" class="bold">here</a>. Our idea and app eventually earned an honorable mention at our class' final presentations. You can also see the poster for our presentation <a href="img/stepnote/poster.pdf" target="_blank" class="bold">here</a>.</p>
