            Digital Canvas was a student-initiated course within Stanford's computer science department created to teach students the basics of visual design. I joined the teaching staff for the first offering of the course, leading in-class critiques and helping to develop the curriculum before co-instructing two offerings later.

            While Stanford is well-known for teaching design thinking at the d.school, there are not many resources for students to learn visual design skills that might be easily accessible at art schools. Students can pick up bits here and there in human-computer interaction and art classes, but there is a clear gap in the curriculum. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital Canvas was created to fill this gap, covering layout, typography, color, and more over ten weeks. And throughout the academic quarter, students work on a quarter-long project designing a website of their choosing, moving from sketches and wireframes to full mockups in Sketch.

            What makes Digital Canvas unique is its structure, as each class is split into lecture and critique components. Every week, lectures introduced new topics for students to incorporate into their quarter-long projects designing a website of their choosing.</a>.

            Working in tandem with the lectures, critiques provided an open forum for students to solicit feedback on their week-to-week milestones and comment on the work of their peers. Most importantly, these critiques helped develop within students the language necessary to give and receive visual design feedback. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With an enrollment cap of 20 students and 4 teaching staff, we enforced a 5:1 student-teacher ratio to ensure that students received individual attention and mentorship. Additionally, we were lucky to have design professionals from companies like Palantir and 1185 Design guest lecture and give feedback on students' projects.

            Taught in three quarters over two years, Digital Canvas was well-received, with strong class ratings and reviews for the computer science department. Each quarter brought numerous applicants from a wide variety of academic majors and disciplines. However, what was most rewarding was seeing the progress students were able to make in just ten weeks.
