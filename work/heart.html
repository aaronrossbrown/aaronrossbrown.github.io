            Heart is a multi-platform concept created for the Andreesen Horowitz + IDEO Designathon that aims to generate more empathy and compassion for the homeless. Consisting of a mobile app, connected debit card, and web portal, it also provides a secure and convenient way to give to people you might pass by on the street.

            Homelessness is a highly complex social issue that affects many urban centers. For the designathon, we were tasked to create digital tools that might help to alleviate homelessness. I worked with on a team of four to come up with a human-centered solution that might work in San Francisco. We had just three hours: it was a sprint to brainstorm, conceptualize, and present our ideas to the judges.

            To develop empathy for the stakeholders involved, we dove deep into our research, speaking to staff members at <a href="http://www.glide.org/">GLIDE</a>. Hearing their firsthand experiences in working with the homeless, as well as stories of people who were formerly homeless and now adjusted back into society, we were able to distill a few insights:
          </p>
          <h4>
            While passerby might not be able to donate, their support can still be meaningful.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            A donation is great, but someone who will listen to your story can be even better.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            To improve their situations, people need to feel loved in order to feel love for themselves.
          </h4>

            Jotting down our ideas, we wanted to focus on giving passerby a way of interacting and perhaps helping a homeless person they might pass on the street, in a way that didn't feel inconvenient or unsafe. Integrating RFID tags and beacons, we continued to ideate, picking and choosing the best suggestions to synthesize into a solution.

            In three hours, we came up with a concept for a multi-platform solution that could enable both passerby and the homeless. We envisioned a mobile app for passerby and a connected debit card/web portal for the homeless.

            Imagine that, on your way to work, you pass someone on the street who asks you for change. Unfortunately, you don't have the time to dig through your wallet for a couple of dollars, but with the Heart mobile app you can send your support even after you've made it to the office.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the app, you can see people you've passed and read about their story: where they're coming from, how they're feeling, and what they need. You can support them with a heart to let them know you care, and you can even donate or volunteer if you so choose.

            Now put yourself in the place of the man or woman who was passed on the street. It's unlikely that you have a smartphone that you can load with apps. However, on your next stop by the homeless shelter, you can check in online. There, you can add a profile with a story and updates, but more importantly, you can see the people that have supported to you and donated to you over the course of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            And how are the phones of passerby able to know when someone in need of help is nearby? Once a homeless person has created a web portal for the first time, they receive a debit card equipped with a tag that phones can interact with. The debit card allows people to spend their donations at partner stores and eateries in the neighborhood (and not on drugs or alcohol), and their balance can easily be checked via SMS text.

            Over time, as people's situations hopefully improve, updates will push to people that have supported them. And when you walk through the same neighborhoods day after day, you can know that the man asking for change on the corner has a name and a story, and that his life is changing for the better.
