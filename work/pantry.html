            In every kitchen, it's always difficult to know what foods are in pantry and what foods need to be bought on the next grocery run. Pantry is a collaborative mobile web app that helps keep track of items and ingredients in a shared kitchen.

            In shared kitchens, there's often a gap in how the kitchen is managed: with many people sharing a kitchen and its contents, it's often difficult to properly restock and keep track of foods and ingredients.

            This problem is evident in many dorms on Stanford's campus. At Stanford, dorm houses often have kitchen managers to help manage the snacks and ingredients available in open kitchens. But with 60 students sharing a single kitchen, things can get a little chaotic. It's difficult to buy foods to please people's varying tastes, and to know when certain snacks or ingredients need to be restocked.

            Seeing the dorm's wish list for foods grow more unruly week after week, we were inspired to do something about it. Looking at the check marks of support, we figured we could translate the dorm's grocery list to an online version with upvoting and downvoting Ã  la Reddit. Before long, we had also incorporated a way to keep track of foods already in the pantry, as well as a recipe generator based on available ingredients.

            In designing and developing Pantry, we leveraged Google Analytics to do some A/B testing on our voting features. We also performed some heuristic evaluations with our target users to find room for improvement in our app's interface.

            Over time, our idea had evolved from a grocery list with upvoting to collaborative pantry-tracking app, with three main features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Shared Pantry</p>
              <p>
                The core of the app is the Shared Pantry feature. With it, you can see the names of items in the pantry, along with their corresponding categories and expiration dates. You can sort by name, category, or date, and it's easy to add or edit items in the pantry.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Grocery List</p>
              <p>
                The Grocery List allows collaborators in a pantry to contribute item ideas for the kitchen manager. With upvoting, it's easy to see which items need to be picked up at the store. And upon returning home, there's a simple button to move grocery list items directly to the pantry.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Smart Recipes</p>
              <p>
                We were able to leverage the Yummly API to give users an easy way to cook out of their pantry. Parsing through the inventory, the app recommends recipes for users to make the most of their available ingredients.
