            Stepnote is a web-based tool created to help record and recall ideas in the choreography process. The tool allows choreographers to annotate a waveform for a song and easily share their ideas with other dancers.

            Stepnote originated as a project for a human-computer interaction design class. In teams of three, we were tasked to create web or mobile applications around the context of data narratives. We quickly looked towards the complex creative process of choreographers and saw an opportunity for a better tool.

            Understanding Choreographers
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4-8 col-4-4">
          <p>
            Focusing in on designing a tool for choreography, we first talked to our main stakeholders: the choreographers themselves. Meeting with a wide range of choreographers from classical Indian dance to hip hop, we wanted to understand how choreographers chose music, looked for inspiration, and constructed their dance routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things were clear and evident by the end of our interviews. First, the process behind choreography varies person to person and is often unique, with some users taking detailed notes with timestamps and others taking minimal or no notes at all. Second, every choreographer struggled to recall things, whether it was an inspiring dance move from a YouTube video, or the latest set of steps they chose when they last sat down to choreograph.
          </p>
          <p>
            To condense the diverse set of skill levels, behaviors, and attitudes of the choreographers we talked to, we created three user personas to design for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Freestyle Freddie</p>
              <p>
                Freddie is a creative when it comes to his choreography, and he picks music that really "speaks to him." He gleans inspiration from the music's melodies and rhythms, relying on his mental notes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Structured Shilpa</p>
              <p>
                Shilpa records all her steps and ideas in her process, often taking videos of her movements. She relies on a specific dictionary of steps, meaning she is limited to only the steps that come to mind.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Novice Nancy</p>
              <p>
                Nancy is still learning choreography—she relies heavily on videos of other dances for inspiration. She often finds exciting steps, but has trouble incorporating them into her routines.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-4-8 col-4-4">
          <p>
            With a struggle to recall ideas being the main gap in our users' behavior, we brainstormed some concepts to help users remember their sources of inspiration and the dance moves that they were choreographing. Some concepts focused on splicing existing moves from YouTube videos, while others helped choreographers understand their repertoire of steps.

            Moving forward, we decided to stick with our best idea, Song Annotator—the idea was feasible to prototype and test in three weeks, and it seemed to resonate best with the choreographers we interviewed. Now there remained two questions to answer. What screen size would we develop for, web or mobile? And what format of annotations would we support: text, audio, or video?
          </p>
          <p>
            We quickly moved to low-fidelity paper prototypes, testing the possible combinations of screen size and annotation format with multiple choreographers. Before, long, we had chosen a web application that would support text based annotations.

            Testing the Interface
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4-8 col-4-4">
          <p>
            As we began to develop our idea into a working prototype, questions about the user interface and interactions began to arise.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Would users prefer to annotate moments or ranges?
              </p>
              <p>
                With timestamp-linked annotations, one of our implementation questions was enabling users to annotate either specific moments or longer ranges in the music. While users appreciated the flexibility of annotating ranges, annotating singular moments was less confusing overall.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What time should be used for an annotation's timestamp?
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two options here: once a user starts to type their note, or once a user enters and submits their annotation. Our users preferred the former, as mistakes while typing could shift their annotation timestamp in the latter case.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What might users make annotations about?
              </p>
              <p>
                Users made notes and ideas on everything: references to YouTube videos, ideas for different steps, or possible formations for the group. We noticed that users often worked within specific categories of annotations.

            We built our web application using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Before long, we had our working prototype, with these main features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Simple waveform visualization and playback
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking towards SoundCloud for inspiration, we leveraged a JavaScript library to integrate a visual waveform of the music being choreographed for. Users appreciated the simple playback controls and overlaid annotations.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Lightweight interface for ease of use
              </p>
              <p>
                The interface isn't complex, and it makes a lot of sense: you can use your spacebar to pause and play music just like most apps, and annotations are highlighted as the music play.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Easy annotations with timestamps and motifs
              </p>
              <p>
                Timestamp-linked annotations mean that users don't have to pause, check, and manually enter the time each time they want to note something. And motifs offer a functionality akin to hashtags for grouping notes.
              </p>

            Choreographers loved Stepnote, and our teaching staff loved our process and output. Users described our prototype as "surprisingly natural," "sick," and "a dream." The idea was well-received and we received an honorable mention at our final presentations. Looking toward the future, our users saw potential in our product, and with more time, we would've loved to add multi-user annotation and shareable links for collaboration.
