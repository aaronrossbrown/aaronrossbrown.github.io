            <p>
              <a href="https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-in-new-york" class="underline">Stanford in New York</a> is a program for Stanford undergraduates to live and learn in New York, providing the opportunity to immerse students in the resources and culture of the city. I was lucky enough to be apart of the programâ€™s first class in Fall 2015, with areas of focus in the arts, architecture, design, and urban studies.

              Having lived in Silicon Valley all my life, it was exciting to switch from the Bay Area to the Big Apple, even if only for a quarter. As part of the program, participants work at internships 4 days a week while taking a full course load of classes. I had the privilege of working at <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" class="underline">IDEO</a> in their New York studio, where I was able to learn from some of the best and brightest designers I've ever worked with.

            <h1>Redesigning the Wallboard</h1>
            <p>
              During my time at IDEO, I worked within a team of designers to help redesign Wilsonart's sample wallboard, which lives in the workspaces of interior designers and architects worldwide. While I can't share further details, feel free to read more about the project and its outcomes in the <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/press-room/wilsonart-reinvents-the-wallboard-by-including-mobile-access-for-sample-refills" class="underline">press release</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/ideo-stories/whats-in-a-hole-afd7579a365d" class="underline">Medium article</a>.
